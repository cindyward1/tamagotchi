Description:
This Web application allows the user to choose a Tamagotchi character from an array, displays the character's image, and displays buttons which the user can press to feed the Tamagotchi, play with it, put it to sleep, and give it medicine. If the Tamagotchi gets too hungry or unhealthy, it will die, the game is lost, and the displayed Tamagotchi character's image fades away.
